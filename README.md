# Fabman Self Sign-Up plugin for Google Sheets & Google Forms

A plugin for Google Sheets / Google Forms that allows you to create a self sign-up form for your members.
[You can install it directly from the Google Workspace Marketplace.](https://workspace.google.com/u/1/marketplace/app/fabman_self_signup/252541183462)


## Field mappings

If you map multiple form fields to the same Fabman field, their answers will be concatenated. That’s useful if you want to put multiple answers into the "notes" field in Fabman, for example.
